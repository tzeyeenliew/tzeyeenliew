## Data Engineer Trainee  

### 📚 **MY PROJECTS**  
**As a Trainee Data Engineer**  
Focusing on end-to-end pipeline building, infrastructure automation, and client-ready reporting.  

---

**Sprint 1 – Foundations of Data Engineering (Pokémon Pipeline)**  
[View Sprint/Project Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGfBGpM1Yg/lv4gQWLe1yjOzJUG4SZRrQ/edit?utm_content=DAGfBGpM1Yg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)  
Built an end-to-end pipeline (ADF → Databricks → SQL) for the Pokémon dataset. Compared performance between SQL and Databricks clusters.  

**Sprint 2 – SQL & Data Modelling (Super Secret Company)**

Created a dynamic ADF pipeline triggered by reqInfo.json. Cleaned and transformed weather data using Spark, applied caching and persistence.  

**Sprint 5 – NS Train Notifier**  
[View Sprint/Project Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGvoH0UCcs/r8bAMzUt55JjTyOT2Y5Gng/edit?utm_content=DAGvoH0UCcs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)  
Built an Azure Logic App to send Teams alerts with real-time NS API train data. Used ADF and conditional logic for flexible automation.  

**Sprint 6 – [REDACTED] Insights Power BI Dashboard (Sanitized)**  
Designed and delivered a sales analytics dashboard using Power BI. Modeled Clean Data + dimensions, created KPI measures to evaluate bundling uplift, and provided actionable market insights based on sales patterns. Name of client redacted to protect client's privacy.

**Sprint 7 – Microsoft Fabric (Emoji Analytics Platform)**
