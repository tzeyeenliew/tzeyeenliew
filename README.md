Created a dynamic ADF pipeline triggered by reqInfo.json. Cleaned and transformed weather data using Spark, applied caching and persistence.  

**Sprint 5 ‚Äì NS Train Notifier**  
[View Sprint/Project Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGvoH0UCcs/r8bAMzUt55JjTyOT2Y5Gng/edit?utm_content=DAGvoH0UCcs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)  
Built an Azure Logic App to send Teams alerts with real-time NS API train data. Used ADF and conditional logic for flexible automation.  

**Sprint 6 ‚Äì [REDACTED] Insights Power BI Dashboard (Sanitized)**  
Designed and delivered a sales analytics dashboard using Power BI. Modeled Clean Data + dimensions, created KPI measures to evaluate bundling uplift, and provided actionable market insights based on sales patterns. Name of client redacted to protect client's privacy.

**Sprint 7 ‚Äì Microsoft Fabric (Emoji Analytics Platform)**
